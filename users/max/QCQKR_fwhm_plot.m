function [fig_handle, fig_filename] = QCQKR_fwhm_plot(RunDatas,varied_variable_name,legendvars,varargin,options)
% PLOTFUNCTIONTEMPLATE makes a plot from the given RunDatas against the
% dependent variable {varied_variable_name}. Optional arguments are passed
% to setupPlot, which automatically puts axes and a legend on the plot,
% resizes the axes, etc.
% 
%         I recommend starting out by not touching the optional arguments.
%
% The RunDatas input can either be a single RunData object, or a cell array
% of RunData objects.
%
% varied_variable_name is the cicero variable name (as a string) of the
% independent variable for the RunDatas you've provided.
%
% legendvars must be specified as a cell array of strings. The names of
% the variables are used as the title of the legend, and their values for
% each plotted RunData are added to the legend.
%
% varargin can be provided as a cell array of cicero variable names which
% are held constant across ALL RunDatas provided in the set. These
% variables (and their values) are added to the plot title. 
%
%       For variables held constant in just one RunData out of the provided
%       set (such as the 915 depth when plotting widths of many runs vs.
%       time on the same axes), specify those variables in legendvars so
%       that the runs will be labeled in the legend.

% Just copy-paste this arguments list. You can of course add more arguments
% to your own functions.

    % before writing the rest of the plot function.
    
    % You could also feed avgRepeats a cell array of RunDatas, as done
    % below. If you do, it will try to repeat-average all of them together.
    % Careful here -- I haven't put in error messages for if you feed it
    % RunDatas that shouldn't be repeat-averaged, and will yield unexpected
    % results. Better handling is in development.

    % compute and plot whichever quantities you want to plot.
    %
    % The output of plotFunctions should include a figure handle and a
    % filename to which the figure can be saved. Define the handle when you
    % make the figure. The filename will be generated later.
    %
    % I also define a colormap here to get good contrast between the
    % different traces (with default, more than 5 traces will start
